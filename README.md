# Important Notices

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> Since the GitHub API only [allows 5k requests per hour per user account](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/resource-limitations), the public instance hosted on `https://togp.xyz` could possibly hit the rate limited and result in a ratelimit error response. To avoid this, prioritze using caching on github or [deploying your own instance](#deployment)

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> This is a small project, and the host is not free. To support me, consider starring this repo!


## Introduction

`Terminal ogp` is providing an alternative to [github opengraphs](https://opengraph.githubassets.com/somerandomshit/douxxtech/terminal-ogp) images that i find kinda boring. It uses images that are terminal-like to get a more "tecchie" look that i find cool !

<h6>Terminal-ogp is a <a href="https://dpip.lol" target="_blank">DPIP.lol</a> project.</h6>

## Features

- [X] Themes
- [X] No caching issues
- [X] No 500 errors
- [X] Always return an svg
- [ ] Convert svgs to pngs
- [X] Orgs support

## How to use

### 1. In a ReadMe
To use a terminal opengraph in your readme, take this following code and paste it into your readme:
```md
![Terminal GitOpenGraphImage](https://togp.xyz/?owner=YOUR_USERNAME&repo=YOUR_REPO&avatar=false)
```
This will show the image in your readme, make sure to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO` by the actual values. Setting avatar to true will add your avatar in the bottom right corner.

> Note => If you need your image to be updated each time you reload the readme, set the parameter `cache` to false (add `&cache=false` in the URL)

## Themes

> [!NOTE]  
> There are several themes of this API, **BUT WE NEED MORE** ! If you got an idea, [please check the tutorial to provide us your very own theme !](themes/PUBLISH.md)

Use `?theme=THEME_NAME` parameter like so:

```md
![togp](https://togp.xyz/?owner=douxxtech&repo=terminal-ogp&theme=json-dark-all)
```

[Check all the themes here !](themes/THEMES.md)

## Errors returned by the API

The API may can return an error page if something went wrong or is missing.  

![Error image](https://togp.xyz/svg/error.svg)

The error message will most of the time tell where the error occured, so just follow the instructions to fix it.
However, if the error message doesn't help you, [consider opening an issue](https://github.com/douxxtech/terminal-ogp/issues/new)
